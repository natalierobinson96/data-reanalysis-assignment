# Summary of Paper

  Orangutans have exceptionally high rates of forced copulations. Traditionally, it was assumed that this was a strategy used by unflanged males, who are sexually mature but have not developed secondary sexual characteristics like prime males who have large cheek flanges. Little thought was given to how female strategies may have shaped or responded to this behavior. Knott et al. (2010) found that male morph alone was not a good predictor of mating dynamics among wild Bornean orangutans (*Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii*), but rather female conception risk mediated the occurence of male-female interactions.

This is an adult female, Delly, with her infant Duwyk.
  
  Knott et al. (2010) assayed urine samples and compared ovarian hormone profiles with the sexual behavior of females and males in order to understand the females' ovulatory cycles (as they do not have obvious sexual swellings). Behavioral data was collected from 1994-2003 at the Cabang Panti Research Site in Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. During the 45,500 hours of observation, 387 encounters occured between males and females. Of these, male and female reproductive status could be determined for 153 encounters. 21 matings (between 10 males and 7 females) were observed during these encounters. They found that females were more likely to mate cooperatively with prime flanged males near ovulation, while they were more willing to associate and mate with non-prime males when conception risk was low.

# Required Packages
First, I loaded in the required packages.
```{r}
library(curl)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stats)
library(AICcmodavg)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(graphics)
library(lme4)
library(car)
library(lmerTest)
```

# Obtaining the Data
I first recieved this data in various files of .sav format, as it had been exported from SPSS. I was able to open the files in R using the "foreign" package and the command read.spss, though I decided it would be easier to manipulate the data if it were in a .csv file, as I am more familiar with this.

I was able to do this online using [this website](http://pspp.benpfaff.org/) where you can upload a .sav file and then download the corresponding .csv file. The files are available in my Github repository titled "data-reanalysis-assignment." First, I loaded in the main csv file, which contains all of the compiled data.

```{r}
# getting the data into R
library(curl)
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalierobinson96/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/matings%20with%20endocrine%20data.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(d)
```

# Figure 1 (Descriptive)
First I replicated Figure 1 from the paper. This figure shows the distribution of matings with respect to male type and female ovulatory status.

First I created 3 variables of female mating type. Each female was either pregnant, in the periovulatory period, or neither (non-periovulatory).

```{r}
nonPOP <- filter(d, preg == "0" & POP == "0")
nonPOP #matings with females not in periovulatory period; currently cycling
```

```{r}
pregnant <- filter(d, preg == "1")
pregnant #matings with pregnant females 
```

```{r}
POP <- filter(d, POP == "1")
POP #matings with females in periovulatory period
```

Next I created 6 more variables which will serve as each entry of the replicated bar plot. The 3 female ovulatory statuses stay the same, though they are divided bewtween those who mated with prime males and those who mated with non-prime males (either unflanged or past-prime).
For each variable I also counted the number of occurences of the type of mating by counting the number of rows.

```{r}
nonPOP_nonprime <- filter(nonPOP, prime == "0")
nonPOP_nonprime
totalmatings1 <- length(attributes(nonPOP_nonprime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
nonPOP_prime <- filter(nonPOP, prime == "1")
nonPOP_prime
totalmatings2 <- length(attributes(nonPOP_prime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
pregnant_nonprime <- filter(pregnant, prime == "0")
pregnant_nonprime
totalmatings3 <- length(attributes(pregnant_nonprime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
pregnant_prime <- filter(pregnant, prime == "1")
pregnant_prime
totalmatings4 <- length(attributes(pregnant_prime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
POP_nonprime <- filter(POP, prime == "0")
POP_nonprime
totalmatings5 <- length(attributes(POP_nonprime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
POP_prime <- filter(POP, prime == "1")
POP_prime
totalmatings6 <- length(attributes(POP_prime)$row.names)
```

I then created a vector of each of the values of occurences.
```{r}
v <- c(totalmatings1, totalmatings2, totalmatings3, totalmatings4, totalmatings5, totalmatings6)

barplot(v, main = "Figure 1", xlab = "female endocrine status", ylab = "mating events observed", names.arg = c("non-periovulatory","non-periovulatory","pregnant","pregnant", "periovulatory", "periovulatory"), col = "black", density = c(100, 0, 100, 0, 100, 0), space = c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0))
```

This is what the original figure from the paper looked like:

<img src="img/Figure 1.pdf" width="500px"/>

They are the same! As stated in the paper, this figure shows that non-periovulatory females mated most frequently with non-prime males, while periovulatory females mated most frequently with prime males. 

It is possible that there is a more concise way to replicate this figure, though this way seemed the most logical to me, given the format of the data.

# Figure 2 (Descriptive)

The second figure in the paper shows the distribution of female encounters with males, with respect to male type and female ovulatory status. I planned to use a similar method to create this figure as I did for the first one (the dependent variable is now 'encounters observed'), though I ran into a lot of problems. 

I recieved this dataset from the professor who is first author on this paper. She did not have the original files, so she reached out to the author who ran all the statistics for the paper. He emailed her zipped folders of all of the old versions of the dataset that he had. She then forwarded these folders to me, which contained hundreds of different documents which spanned the course of nearly 3 years. Unfortunately, all the observation data was spread out between different files which led to confusion. Additionally, the same writing conventions were not used throughout all the daat. For example, some variables were recorded as full words like "Prime" and "Nonprime" , while others were recorded as binary numbers "0" and "1". 

## Attempt 1

To begin the second replication, I first converted another SPSS file into csv format and loaded it in to R. This file contains all 2460 orangutan follows.
```{r}
# getting the data into R
library(curl)
f2 <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalierobinson96/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/interactions.csv")
d2 <- read.csv(f2, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(d2)
```

Next I created a new dataframe which only includes the observation entries (in which a male and female interacted with each other) which were included in the final analysis (in which both male and female reproductive status were known):
```{r}
d2 <- filter(d2, InteractionwithMale == "Y")
d2 <- filter(d2, included == "1")
head(d2)
```

This contains 331 observations, however, the paper states that only 153 encounters were included in the analysis. I continued on anyway.

As before, I created the 3 categories of female endocrine status:
```{r}
nonPOP <- filter(d2, lact == "1")
head(nonPOP) #matings with females not in periovulatory period; currently cycling
```

```{r}
pregnant <- filter(d2, preg == "1")
head(pregnant) #matings with pregnant females 
```

```{r}
POP <- filter(d2, POP == "1")
head(POP) #matings with females in periovulatory period
```

I created 6 more variables which serve as each entry of the replicated bar plot. The 3 female ovulatory statuses stay the same, though they are divided bewtween those who encountered prime males and those who encountered non-prime males (either unflanged or past-prime).
For each variable I also counted the number of occurences of encounters by counting the number of rows. This is the same as what I did in the initial replication.

```{r}
nonPOP_nonprime <- filter(nonPOP, prime == "0")
totalmatings1 <- length(attributes(nonPOP_nonprime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
nonPOP_prime <- filter(nonPOP, prime == "1")
totalmatings2 <- length(attributes(nonPOP_prime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
pregnant_nonprime <- filter(pregnant, prime == "0")
totalmatings3 <- length(attributes(pregnant_nonprime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
pregnant_prime <- filter(pregnant, prime == "1")
totalmatings4 <- length(attributes(pregnant_prime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
POP_nonprime <- filter(POP, prime == "0")
totalmatings5 <- length(attributes(POP_nonprime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
POP_prime <- filter(POP, prime == "1")
totalmatings6 <- length(attributes(POP_prime)$row.names)
```

I then created a vector of each of the values of occurences.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
v2 <- c(totalmatings1, totalmatings2, totalmatings3, totalmatings4, totalmatings5, totalmatings6)

barplot(v2, main = "Figure 2", xlab = "female endocrine status", ylab = "encounters observed", names.arg = c("non-periovulatory","non-periovulatory","pregnant","pregnant", "periovulatory", "periovulatory"), col = "black", density = c(100, 0, 100, 0, 100, 0), space = c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0))
```

This is what the figure from the paper looks like:

<img src="img/Figure 2.pdf" width="500px"/>

This replication did not turn out the same as the original figure. The "pregnant" and "periovulatory" categories look correct, though the values for the "non-periovulatory" category are too low. Unsure how to fix this, I tried using a different file, which contained a shortened version of the interaction data.

## Attempt 2

I loaded in the other converted file and created a new dataframe which only includes the observations which are in the final analysis:
```{r}
# getting the data into R
library(curl)
f2 <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalierobinson96/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/interactions%20(short).csv")
d2 <- read.csv(f2, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
d2 <- filter(d2, InteractionwithMale == "Y")
head(d2)
```

This file already had the interactions divided into columns of the 6 categories for the barplot, so I filtered these out. 
```{r}
nonPOP_nonprime <- filter(d2, nPOPnprime == "1")
totalmatings1 <- length(attributes(nonPOP_nonprime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
nonPOP_prime <- filter(d2, nPOPprime == "1")
totalmatings2 <- length(attributes(nonPOP_prime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
pregnant_nonprime <- filter(d2, CYCNprime == "1")
totalmatings3 <- length(attributes(pregnant_nonprime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
pregnant_prime <- filter(d2, CYCprime == "1")
totalmatings4 <- length(attributes(pregnant_prime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
POP_nonprime <- filter(d2, POPnprime == "1")
totalmatings5 <- length(attributes(POP_nonprime)$row.names)
```
```{r}
POP_prime <- filter(d2, POPprime == "1")
totalmatings6 <- length(attributes(POP_prime)$row.names)
```

I then created a vector of each of the values of occurences.
```{r}
v2 <- c(totalmatings1, totalmatings2, totalmatings3, totalmatings4, totalmatings5, totalmatings6)

barplot(v2, main = "Figure 2", xlab = "female endocrine status", ylab = "encounters observed", names.arg = c("non-periovulatory","non-periovulatory","pregnant","pregnant", "periovulatory", "periovulatory"), col = "black", density = c(100, 0, 100, 0, 100, 0), space = c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0))
```

Here, the "periovulatory" columns remain correct, the "pregnant" columns are now too high, and the "non-periovulatory" columns remain incorrect. 

## Attempt 3

After trying more iterations of code with both of the files, I noticed a column titled "endomiss" in the original long version of the interactions file. This column is filled in for each interaciton observation with either a "0" or "1". My best guess is that this indicates whether or not the endocrine data from urine samples is missing or not. "0" would indicate that it is not missing (so the interaction can be used), while "1" would indicate that the endocrine data is missing, and should be excluded from the analysis. I added this into the filter of my original code to see if it would help me.

First, I loaded the original set of data in to R.
```{r}
library(curl)
f2 <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalierobinson96/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/interactions.csv")
d2 <- read.csv(f2, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

Next I created a new dataframe which only includes the observation entries which were included in the final analysis.
```{r}
d2 <- filter(d2, InteractionwithMale == "Y")
d2 <- filter(d2, included == "1")
d2 <- filter(d2, endomiss == "0")
head(d2) # I got it down to the 153 observations!!
```
Finally, this dataframe contains 153 rows -- the correct number of observations!

As before, I created the 3 categories of female endocrine status:
```{r}
nonPOP <- filter(d2, preg == "0" & POP == "0") #matings with females not in periovulatory period; currently cycling
```
```{r}
pregnant <- filter(d2, preg == "1") #matings with pregnant females 
```
```{r}
POP <- filter(d2, POP == "1") #matings with females in periovulatory period
```

Then I created 6 more variables which will serve as each entry of the replicated bar plot. The 3 female ovulatory statuses stay the same, though they are divided bewtween those who encountered prime males and those who encountered non-prime males (either unflanged or past-prime).
For each variable I also counted the number of occurences of encounters by counting the number of rows.

```{r}
nonPOP_nonprime <- filter(nonPOP, prime == "0")
totalmatings1 <- length(attributes(nonPOP_nonprime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
nonPOP_prime <- filter(nonPOP, prime == "1")
totalmatings2 <- length(attributes(nonPOP_prime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
pregnant_nonprime <- filter(pregnant, prime == "0")
totalmatings3 <- length(attributes(pregnant_nonprime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
pregnant_prime <- filter(pregnant, prime == "1")
totalmatings4 <- length(attributes(pregnant_prime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
POP_nonprime <- filter(POP, prime == "0")
totalmatings5 <- length(attributes(POP_nonprime)$row.names)
```

```{r}
POP_prime <- filter(POP, prime == "1")
totalmatings6 <- length(attributes(POP_prime)$row.names)
```

I then created a vector of each of the values of occurences.
```{r}
v2 <- c(totalmatings1, totalmatings2, totalmatings3, totalmatings4, totalmatings5, totalmatings6)

barplot(v2, main = "Figure 2", xlab = "female endocrine status", ylab = "encounters observed", names.arg = c("non-periovulatory","non-periovulatory","pregnant","pregnant", "periovulatory", "periovulatory"), col = "black", density = c(100, 0, 100, 0, 100, 0), space = c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0))
```

Again, this is what the figure from the paper looks like:

<img src="img/Figure 2.pdf" width="500px"/>

They are the same!

Though the code for creating this graph is simple, the difficult part of replication was sorting through all the data that was sent to me. I was given separate spreadsheets (of various different formats) from different dates containing different data. This made it very difficult to figure out which data I should use for each part of the replication. This has taught me an important lesson for my own future research/data collection. A cleaner/simpler dataset allows less room for error in analysis and is overall more user-friendly. 

# Linear Mixed Model Analysis (Inferential)

  To make sense of this data, Knott et al. (2010) used linear mixed model analyses. As explained in the paper, all random effects were intercept only and used female identity as the subject identifier. Male identity was not used to characterize non-independence because male inclusion in the observations was not under researcher control. Additionally, female reproductive status varies substantially more than the male-specific variable of prime vs. non-prime.  
  
  For continuous outcomes (such as the number of resistant behaviors observed), the authors used mixed linear models. This was done in an SPSS program called MIXED. I will use the lmer() function in the lme4 package. Since the number of behaviors in each category were skewed, log transformed variables were used for the analysis, and were later returned to linear values for the reporting of estimates (Figure 3 in the paper). The same modeling was done for the association between male and female behavior during mating interactions.
  
    For binary outcomes (such as type of male encountered and the occurence of mating), mixed logistic models were used. The authors used the logit.mixed procedure in R, though this package is no longer available. Instead, I used the glmer() function in the lme4 package for my replication. 

## Linear Mixed Model Analysis of Female and Male Behaviors Observed During Copulation (Table 1)

Table 1 in the paper (below) shows the results of linear mixed model analyses of different female and male behaviors during mating.  The behaviors in each category were skewed, so log-transformed variables were used for analysis. The authors used female reproductive status and male type as main effects. In separate models, the interaction of female reproductive status and male type were included to test the primary hypotheses. Results are reported as F statistics, meaning an ANOVA was done to test the significant differences between models. The rows indicate the type of behavior, and the columns indicate which variable was left in the model when being compared with the full model (with female reproductive status and male type).

<img src="img/Table 1.pdf" width="500px"/>

The authors decided that in order to investigate the distribution of male and female behaviors within matings, they needed to use a more inclusive dataset (rather than the 22 observations of mating where all reproductive statuses were known). Thus, observations of mating with unclassified reproductive state were assumed to be non-periovulatory, as this is the state in which females are most likely to be in due to their long inter-birth intervals. This prevents having categories with zero observations and creates a larger sample size.

First I loaded in the dataset and altered the dataframe so that only the relevant columns were showing.
```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalierobinson96/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/ohmatingspss2.csv")
d4 <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
d4 <- select(d4, FEMALE, FReproStatus, MALE, MALE.AGE.CLASS.I, TOTAL.PROCEPTIVE, TOTAL.RESISTANCE, MALE.AGGRESSION)
head(d4)
```
```{r}
summary(d4)
```

As done in Module 18, I began with some exploratory visualization.
First, I looked at the proceptive behaviors from females in relation to each individual female. This plot shows that there is a lot of variation between the number of proceptive behaviors observed between different females. This is why the female ID was treated as a random effect.
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
boxplot(data = d4, TOTAL.PROCEPTIVE ~ FEMALE, col = c("lightpink1"))
```
Variation can also be seen in number of resistance behaviors between females.
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
boxplot(data = d4, TOTAL.RESISTANCE ~ FEMALE, col = c("lightblue1"))
```

More proceptive behaviors were directed towards flanged males.
```{r}
boxplot(data = d4, TOTAL.PROCEPTIVE ~ MALE.AGE.CLASS.I, col = c("burlywood2", "lightpink1"))
```

This figure displays that the most proceptive behaviors were shown by pregnant females (the median is way higher) as stated in the paper.
```{r}
boxplot(data = d4, TOTAL.PROCEPTIVE ~ FReproStatus, col = c("burlywood2", "lightpink1"))
```

```{r}
boxplot(data = d4, TOTAL.RESISTANCE ~ FReproStatus * MALE.AGE.CLASS.I, col = c("burlywood2", "lightpink1", "lightgreen", "lightblue"))
```

The paper also states that, in contrast to other reports, they found that male aggressive behaviors in the context of mating were performed more often by prime than non-prime males. This trend can be seen in the following plot:
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
boxplot(data = d4, MALE.AGGRESSION ~ MALE.AGE.CLASS.I, col = c("lightpink1"))
```

They explained that these behaviors were not directed significantly more towards any particular female reproductive class.
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
boxplot(data = d4, MALE.AGGRESSION ~ FReproStatus, col = c("lightgreen"))
```

Then I began the replication of the row in which the response variable is "female proceptive behaviours".
```{r}
library(lme4)
lme <- lmer(data = d4, TOTAL.PROCEPTIVE ~ FReproStatus + MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + FReproStatus:MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(lme)
```
```{r}
coefficients(lme)
```

I began by creating the full model, in which both female reproductive status and male type are included as main effects. I also took the log of the number of resistant behaviors, as the authors explained they used log-transformed variables (reproductive status and male type are categorical, so the log can not be done on those variables).
```{r}
full <- lmer(data = d4, log(TOTAL.PROCEPTIVE) ~ FReproStatus + MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(full)
```

Then I created a reduced model, in which only the female reproductive status is considered.
```{r}
reduced1 <- lmer(data = d4, log(TOTAL.PROCEPTIVE) ~ FReproStatus + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(reduced1)
```

Finally, I did an ANOVA comparing the full and reduced models in order to obtain the F-Statistic.
```{r}
anova(reduced1, full, test = "F")
```
This ANOVA (using the anova() function in the {stats} package) provided me with a Chi squared value rather than an F-Statistic (as used in the paper).

I then used the Anova() function in the {car} package to obtain the F-Statistic.
```{r}
library(car)
Anova(reduced1, full, type = c("II", "III", 2, 3), test = "F")
```
This result is different than what was found in the paper. It should be F(2,35.4) = 12.9, p < 0.001 (which is displayed in the first row and first column of Table 1)

I then created a second recuded model in which only the male type is considered.
```{r}
reduced2 <- lmer(data = d4, log(TOTAL.RESISTANCE) ~ MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(reduced2)
```

I ran another ANOVA of the full model and the second recuded model.
```{r}
Anova(reduced2, full, type = c("II", "III", 2, 3), test = "F")
```
This result is also different than what was found in the paper. It should be F(1,21.1) = 2.7, p = 0.117 (as reported in the first row and second column of Table 1).

Next I created new models for female resistant behaviors. These F-Statistics are reported in the second row of Table 1.

I began with a new full model, taking the log of the total number of resistant behaviors.
```{r}
full <- lmer(data = d4, log(TOTAL.RESISTANCE) ~ FReproStatus + MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(full)
```

I created a reduced model in which only the female reproductive status is considered.
```{r}
reduced1 <- lmer(data = d4, log(TOTAL.RESISTANCE) ~ FReproStatus + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(reduced1)
```

I ran an ANOVA to compare these two models
```{r}
Anova(reduced1, full, type = c("II", "III", 2, 3), test = "F")
```
This result is different than what was found in the paper. It should be F(2,42) = 4.2, p = 0.021.

I then created the second reduced model in which only male type is included.
```{r}
reduced2 <- lmer(data = d4, log(TOTAL.RESISTANCE) ~ MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(reduced2)
```

```{r}
Anova(reduced2, full, type = c("II", "III", 2, 3), test = "F")
```
This result is different than what was found in the paper. It should be F(1,42) = 2.7, p = 0.110.

I could not find the observations of male inspection behaviors in the data I was given, so was unable to attempt the replication of this.

Finally, I repeated the above steps for the male aggresive behaviors (the last row of Table 1).
```{r}
full <- lmer(data = d4, log(MALE.AGGRESSION) ~ FReproStatus + MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(full)
```

```{r}
reduced1 <- lmer(data = d4, log(MALE.AGGRESSION) ~ FReproStatus + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(reduced1)
```

I used the Anova() function in the {car} package to obtain the F-Statistic.
```{r}
library(car)
Anova(reduced1, full, type = c("II", "III", 2, 3), test = "F")
```
This result is different than what was found in the paper. It should be F(2,42) = 0, p = 0.966.

```{r}
reduced2 <- lmer(data = d4, log(MALE.AGGRESSION) ~ MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE))
summary(reduced2)
```

```{r}
Anova(reduced2, full, type = c("II", "III", 2, 3), test = "F")
```
This result is different than what was found in the paper. It should be F(1,42) = 5.1, p = 0.029.

The authors also created separate models which include the interaction of female reproductive status and male type.
```{r}
full2 <- lmer(data = d4, TOTAL.PROCEPTIVE ~ FReproStatus:MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE), REML = FALSE)
summary(full2)
```

```{r}
full3 <- lmer(data = d4, TOTAL.RESISTANCE ~ FReproStatus:MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE), REML = FALSE)
summary(full3)
```

```{r}
full4 <- lmer(data = d4, MALE.AGGRESSION ~ FReproStatus:MALE.AGE.CLASS.I + (1 | FEMALE), REML = FALSE)
summary(full4)

I have tried endless variations of this code and still cannot figure out why I am not successfully replicating the analysis. While it is possible that I could have figured this out with more time, I have thought of a few possibilities of where I went wrong. I could be log-transforming the data incorrectly, I could be misinterpretting what Table 1 is meant to show, or I could be using the completely wrong spreadsheet of data. However, I have tried altering all of these factors, and am still unsuccessful. It is also possible that other effects went into the model (such as length of mating, number of pelvic thrusts, juvenile distress behaviors, or forced vs unforced mating) which were not properly explained in the methods section of the paper, and therefore I failed to include them. This is possible, as these variables are recorded in the dataset, though not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Knott et al. (2010) stated that matings lasted an average of 7.9 minutes, with a range of 1-31 minutes.

I loaded in the same dataset I used for the LMM, without any of the prior modifications.
```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalierobinson96/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/ohmatingspss2.csv")
d5 <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
mating_lengths <- d5$Length.of.Mating
mating_lengths
```

It seems as though these values were recorded as seconds, so I will convert them to minutes.
```{r}
mating_mins <- mating_lengths/60
mating_mins
```

Then I calculated the range and mean of these values.
```{r}
range(mating_mins, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(mating_mins, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Here, the range of the lengths of matings is 1-31, which matches what was stated in the paper. However, the average length was longer than what was reported. I am confident that I properly calculated the average of this list of mating lengths, which leads me to believe I may be using the incorrect dataset for this set of analyses, and that is part of the reason I am not getting the same values.

## Generalized Linear Mixed Model -- Type of Male Encountered 

As I was unsucessful with the previous model, I decided to attempt to replicate a GLMM used in the paper, despite not having a complete understanding of this topic. Unfortunately, I did not have time to finish this section of the replication. 

First I loaded in the interactions dataset.
```{r}
f3 <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalierobinson96/data-reanalysis-assignment/master/interactions.csv")
d3 <- read.csv(f3, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

I filtered the data to only inlcude the interactions in which all reproductive statuses were known. I selected only the relevant columns for this analysis.
```{r}
d3 <- filter(d3, endomiss == "0")
d3 <- filter(d3, included == "1")
```

Since the first model has binary outcomes I wanted the observations to be recorded as "0" and "1" instead of "N" and "Y", respectively.
```{r}
SocialInteractionBinary <- revalue(d3$SocialInteraction, c("Y" = 1, "N" = 0, "Maybe" = 0, "partial" = 0, "Data missing" = 0, "Data Missing" = 0, "don't know" = 0, "Missing" = 0))
MaleInteractionBinary <- revalue(d3$InteractionwithMale, c("Y" = 1, "N" = 0, "C" = 0, "Maybe" = 0, "NN" = 0, "y" = 1))
MatingBinary <- revalue(d3$Mating, c("Y" = 1, "N" = 0, "?" = 0))
d3 <- data.frame(SocialInteractionBinary, MaleInteractionBinary, MatingBinary, d3)
d3 <- select(d3, Name2, SocialInteractionBinary, MaleInteractionBinary, MatingBinary, POP, preg, lact, prime, past, unflanged)
head(d3)
```

Then I created a new column which indicated the female reproductive status
```{r}
library(plyr)
d3$femrepo <- NA

for(i in 1:153) {
  if(d3$POP[i] == 1) {
    d3$femrepo[i] <- "POP"
  }
}

for(i in 1:153) {
  if(d3$preg[i] == 1) {
    d3$femrepo[i] <- "preg"
  }
}

for(i in 1:153) {
  if(d3$POP[i] == 0 & d3$preg[i] == 0) {
    d3$femrepo[i] <- "nonPOP"
  }
}

d3$maletype <- NA

for(i in 1:153) {
  if(d3$unflanged[i] == 1) {
    d3$maletype[i] <- "unflanged"
  }
}

for(i in 1:153) {
  if(d3$unflanged[i] == 0) {
    d3$maletype[i] <- "flanged"
  }
}

d3 <- select(d3, Name2, SocialInteractionBinary, MaleInteractionBinary, MatingBinary, femrepo, maletype)
head(d3)
```

```{r}
summary(d3)
```

Here, the fixed effects are the female reproductive status and male type. The random effect is the female ID.
```{r}
full <- glmer(MatingBinary ~ femrepo + maletype + (1|Name2), data = d3, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(full)
```

Knott et al. (2010) found that the distribution of matings was strongly predicted by the interaction of male type and female reproductive status. They found the Chi square for global effect = 425, d.f = 2, p < 0.001
